# Tic_Tac_Toe
Built a Tic Tac Toe game (vs. computer opponent) from scratch. The opponents' decisions are calculated using a minimax-algorithm: by checking all possible moves and outcomes, the computer opponent behaves in an optimal way and is guaranteed to never lose.

I started this project because I wanted to practice my C++ skills. Since then a few months have passed, in which I had the chance to develop my knowledge even further. Looking back at the project now, there are a few things I am not 100% happy with. I take this as a good sign of me having learned a thing or two. Now, instead of trying to perfect this simple project, I have decided to leave it alone and move on to the next, more complex project.
